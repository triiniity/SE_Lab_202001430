P6 - Triangle Classification Problem

A, B, C are the lengths of the sides of a triangle

(a) Equivalence Classes:

- Class 1: Invalid input (non-positive values)
- Class 2: Non-triangle (sum of any two sides is less than or equal to the third side)
- Class 3: Scalene triangle (all three sides have different lengths)
- Class 4: Isosceles triangle (two sides have the same length)
- Class 5: Equilateral triangle (all three sides have the same length)
- Class 6: Right-angled triangle (one angle is a right angle, determined by the Pythagorean theorem)

(b) Test Cases:

| Test Case | Class | Tester Action and Input Data (a,b,c) | Expected Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TC1 | 2 | 3,4,6 | Not a triangle |
| TC2 | 3 | 3,4,5 | Scalene right-angled triangle |
| TC3 | 4 | 4,4,5 | Isosceles Triangle |
| TC4 | 5 | 3,3,3 | Equilateral triangle |
| TC5 | 3 | 5,6,8 | Scalene Triangle |
| TC6 | 1 | -1,3,4 | Invalid input |

**Test sets for coverage criterion:**

Statement coverage test sets: To achieve statement coverage, we need to make sure that every statement in the code is executed at least once.

Test 1: p = empty vector
Test 2: p = vector with one point
Test 3: p = vector with two points with the same y component
Test 4: p = vector with two points with different y components
Test 5: p = vector with three or more points with different y components
Test 6: p = vector with three or more points with the same y component

Branch coverage test sets: To achieve branch coverage, we need to make sure that every possible branch in the code is taken at least once
Test 1: p = empty vector
Test 2: p = vector with one point
Test 3: p = vector with two points with the same y component
Test 4: p = vector with two points with different y components
Test 5: p = vector with three or more points with different y components, and none of them have the same x component
Test 6: p = vector with three or more points with the same y component, and some of them have the same x component
Test 7: p = vector with three or more points with the same y component, and all of them have the same x component

Basic condition coverage test sets: To achieve basic condition coverage, we need to make sure that every basic condition in the code (i.e., every Boolean subexpression) is evaluated as both true and false at least once
Test 1: p = empty vector
Test 2: p = vector with one point
Test 3: p = vector with two points with the same y component, and the first point has a smaller x component
Test 4: p = vector with two points with the same y component, and the second point has a smaller x component
Test 5: p = vector with two points with different y components
Test 6: p = vector with three or more points with different y components, and none of them have the same x component
Test 7: p = vector with three or more points with the same y component, and some of them have the same x component
Test 8: p = vector with three or more points with the same y component, and all of them have the same x component.
