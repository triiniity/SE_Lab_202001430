In the above screenshot most errors are C0116, which is a missing function or method docstring error. This means that a function or method has no docstring which is am importatnt part of documentation and helps other people understand the program.

This is a error thrown due to not following snake_case naming stlye in which each space is replaced with an underscore (_) character, and the first letter of each word is written in lowercase.
Mostly the errors are thrown for variables less than 3 characters (not in PEP8 recommendation). But Pylint checks not only PEP8 recommendations. It has also its own recommendations, one of which is that a variable name should be descriptive and not too short.
